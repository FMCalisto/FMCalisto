## &#x270C; Synopsis

Francisco Maria Calisto is a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Health Informatics (HI) enthusiast. He holds a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Computer Science and Engineering, as well as a Master of Engineering in Information Systems and Computer Engineering at [Instituto Superior Técnico (IST)](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/). Qualified and experienced at working as a Researcher & Software Engineer, his work is settled in several directions. He is a system design thinker who is passionate about exploring how new interactive ideas, technologies, and business models can address the most pressing problems, particularly in healthcare. Francisco has been working with several Associated Laboratories of IST since 2015. Between 2015 and 2017, Francisco was working at [INESC-ID](https://www.inesc-id.pt) and, since then, he is working at [ISR-Lisboa](https://welcome.isr.tecnico.ulisboa.pt) in collaboration with [ITI](https://iti.larsys.pt). Both [ISR-Lisboa](https://welcome.isr.tecnico.ulisboa.pt) and [ITI](https://iti.larsys.pt) are associate laboratories of [LARSyS](https://larsys.pt/), currently being the host laboratories for his Doctoral Program. Researching & Developing (R&D) in areas such as HCI, User-Centered Design (UCD), Information Visualization (InfoVis), and HI, understanding and reducing the user burdens of interactive technologies for health professionals, patients, and people with disabilities through the design of future applications. Also lecturing on those areas during this path. Prior to IST, he was part of several [Entrepreneurship](http://fmcalisto.github.io/#entrepreneur) projects, from Agriculture to Advertisement, building systems for both business areas. He has designed, developed, and evaluated mobile, sensor, and collaborative applications for helping users (*e.g.*, physicians, patients, and so on). His primary research methods involve UCD, InfoVis, technology development, as well as a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods.

## &#x1F64C; Helping Others

Contributing to the open source community can be challenging and sometimes terrifying. One particular challenge is how to expose your problem in a clear way. There are a plenty of [online articles](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/08/03/getting-started-with-contributing-to-open-source/) explaining how to contribute and support the open source community. However, the best way for that, is to understand how could we help the community by giving some examples of Questions & Answers. Next, there are several o my recent examples of helping others through this path.

<!--

Unlike **Python**, the **R** language was developed exclusively to analyze data and to develop solutions and applications that are able to execute statistical analyses and data mining [1]. It is a complete ecosystem for data analysis, with an incredible variety of libraries and packages available.

Most functions of the **R** language are *vectorized*, meaning that [the function will operate on all elements of a vector without needing to loop through and act on each element once at a time][101]. This makes programming more concise, easy to read, and less error-prone. On the contrary, we need to use [NumPy][102] arrays (*i.e.*, the so called [`np.array()`][103] methods) to have vectorized operations in **Python** [2], so that we can better achieve an optimized solution.

**2.** Why does the results show an average difference of time complexity and performance?

**3.** How does Python and R scales out to parallel processing in terms of complexity and performance?
